      <p><span class="kicker light">due</span> <strong>Your updated portfolio site is due Friday before midnight.</strong> Get in touch early if you’re lost.</p></p>

      <p><span class="kicker light">Lost?</span> Drop any and all questions in <a href="https://j360.slack.com/messages">Slack</a>. I'll have office hours this week in the <a href="https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/g55oo7bougg6b5f326f7m4avcya">Google Hangout</a> (just jump in, I'll be in there) <strong>from 7 to 8 p.m. on Wednesday and Thursday.</strong></p>

      <p><span class="kicker light">Notes</span> A few notes on the assignments from last week. <br><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Nice work on getting your sites published. If they’re not published, you’re gonna need to do that as every assignment will involve your portfolio site in some way. <br><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;File names matter. Use all lowercase, no capitals for file and folder names. 90% of the questions I answered this week were about files being just one or two letters off, or being uppercase instead of lowercase. <br><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Github commit messages should note the changes you made since your last commit. So "changed background" or “fixed broken link in body” would work, as opposed to “second commit”.</p>

      <h3>The Assignment</h3>

      <aside>For this assignment, you can keep everything in one column, stacked on top of each other. But if you’re feeling ambitious, you can try to float things next to each other. It’s a little tricky, but this piece on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/">floats and clears</a> lays it out pretty well. </aside>

      <p>This week’s assignment is deceptively simple. We’re going to strip all of the style away from your portfolio site and build it back up — with a few catches. You can only use black, white or any shade of gray, no other colors. You can only use the font “Georgia”, at 16 pixels, no other fonts or sizes. No images. You can use lines, borders, shades of gray, spacing, text styles (bold, italic, letter-spacing, line-spacing, alignment), width, height, etc. But no color, and only Georgia at size 16. </p>

      <p>Your portfolio site needs to include </p>

      <ul>
        <li>your name</li>
        <li>a few sentences about you</li>
        <li>a list of projects, each project should include:
          <ul>
            <li>date</li>
            <li>title</li>
            <li>short description</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <aside>(You can use these three project descriptions, too. They’re all projects were going to do. They’ll eventually link to those projects.)</aside>
      
      <p>The content for my site would be:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-markup">Larry Buchanan
I’m  a graphics editor at &lt;a href=“http://nytimes.com”&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. Before that I  worked as a freelancer for The New Yorker, The Onion, ESPN and others. Before that, I went to Indiana University, adopted a dog, and lived in a log cabin.

      <h3>You’ll need to code that up.</h3>

      <p>Based on what we just learned about divs and markup, what will this look like in HTML? This will change based on what you want to do and how you want to structure things. But <a href="https://github.com/larrybuch/larrybuch.github.io/blob/master/lesson-2/index.html">here’s what my code looks like</a>.</p>

      <h3>Things to think about.</h3>

      <p>What can I do given these limitations? What design options do I have? What’s most important? How can I signal to users what that is, given these limitations? </p>

      <h3>What now?</h3>

      <p>1. Sketch out your plan. Diagram what your index file should look like, including what the divs should be named and how everything should be grouped.</p>
      <p>2. Code up your new content in your index.html file. </p>
      <p>3. Add a reset stylesheet. <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css">This one</a> from Eric Meyer is good. You’ll want to download it (or copy and paste it) into a file called reset.css, and link it in your &lt;head&gt;.</p>
      <p>4. Delete the junk out of your style.css.</p>
      <p>5. Add this to your css to style everything 16px Georgia.
        <pre><code class="language-css">body {
  font-family: georgia, serif;
  font-size: 16px;
}</code></pre>

      <p>6. Start adding some styleeeeeee.</p>
      <p>7. Once your happy with it, push it up to github.</p>
