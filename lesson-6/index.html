      <h2><span class="light">6.</span> Getting a bit more complicated.</h2>
      <p><span class="kicker light">Goal</span> To start to build more complicated sites. I'll give the you most of the HTML. You have to do the rest.</p>
      <p><span class="kicker light">due</span> <strong>Your assignment is due Friday before midnight.</strong></p>

      <p><span class="kicker light">Lost?</span> Drop any and all questions in <a href="https://j360.slack.com/messages">Slack</a>. I'll have office hours this week in Slack <strong>from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. on Wednesday and by appointment on Thursday</strong>. Don't suffer in silence.</p>

      <h3>Another copying exercise.</h3>
      <p>Here's a screenshot of a site I coded up. You're going to try to replicate this exactly.</p>
      <a href="../images/screenshot.png" target="_blank"><img class="full" src="../images/screenshot.png" alt=""></a>
      <p>Click for full size.</p>
      <p>I've coded up most of the <a href="http://msch-j360.github.io/lesson-6/html.html">HTML</a> for you. But, you'll have to download and include a reset stylesheet, Skeleton (<a href="http://msch-j360.github.io/lesson-6/skeleton.css">which you can download here</a>) and your own style.css file. You will also need to go into the HTML and add "columns" to match the structure I have in the screen shot. Remember, you have 12 columns to work with.</p>
      <p>I'm also using three <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a>: Roboto Condensed (for the h2s), Lora (for the h3/h4s) and Lato (for kickers, and other sans-serf text). The Google Fonts site has some good documentation on how to use their fonts in your projects. You'll need to figure that out.</p>

      <h3>So here's what you'll need to do.</h3>
      <p>1. Create a new github repo inside your j360 folder. Call it news-site</p>
      <p>2. Add all the files you normal need for a project. Your index.html, css folder, and all of your stylesheets (reset, <a href="http://msch-j360.github.io/lesson-6/skeleton.css">skeleton</a>, style.css).</p>
      <p>3. Copy the html from <a href="http://msch-j360.github.io/lesson-6/html.html">here</a>. Hint: You'll have to view the page source to get the HTML. View > Developer > View Page Source</p>
      <p>3. Go through the html and set how many columns each chunk should be using the screenshot as your guide. I'll give you the first one: On the first div with a class of "adbox" you'll want to add two classes: "twelve" and "columns". On the div with a class of main-sidebar you'll want to add two classes: "three" and "columns". And so on.</p>
      <p>4. Once everything is in the right spot, jump into the css. Start at the top, and style things all the way down.</p>
      <p>5. When yours matches mine, commit your changes to github. Create a gh-pages branch and push your changes up to to make them live.</p>
      
      <p>That's all guys. Good luck and let me know if you're stuck. Due on Friday at midnight.</p>
