      <p><span class="kicker light">Goal</span> To think about sizes other than desktop. At this point, we expect websites to work just as well on phones and tablets as they do on desktop.</p>
      <p><span class="kicker light">due</span> <strong>Your assignment is due Sunday before midnight. (because I was late on posting this one)</strong></p>

      <p><span class="kicker light">Lost?</span> Drop any and all questions in <a href="https://j360.slack.com/messages">Slack</a>. I'll have office hours this week in Slack <strong>from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. on Wednesday and by appointment on Thursday</strong>. Don't suffer in silence.</p>

      <h3>Not just desktop anymore.</h3>
      <img class="full" src="images/devices.jpg" alt="">
      <p><strong>We're designing for all of these devices at the same time.</strong> Desktop, tablet, mobile ... watch? Not yet, but soon. All of these different platforms have different considerations. We have much less real estate on a tablet or a phone, so that means we have to design things different.</p>
      <p>We'll start with a simple example and work our way up to something a little more complicated.</p>
      <h3>Secret: You've already been using them.</h3>
      <p>If you look at your news-site example from last week, and resize your browser, you should see all of the columns shrink down and eventually collapse into one. If you look inside the guts of your <code>skeleton.css</code> file, you'll notice that some of the css lines start with <code>@media</code>. Those are media queries. They allow us to target certain screen sizes and set style rules within them.</p>

      <img src="images/media-query.png" alt="">

      <p>I added a media query to this page that changes the background if the page size is between 600 and 650px wide. Resize this browser window and watch the background color change.</p>
      <p>Now inspect the css on this page to try to find the line that makes it do that. Can you modify the line to change the background color to cyan?</p>

      <h3>Let's start a new project.</h3>
      <p>Create a new git-repo inside your J360 folder called <strong>responsive-sites</strong>.</p>
      <p>Set up the project like normal. This should all feel routine. Just going through the motions. Create an index.html file, paste in the boilerplate HTML, create a css folder with a style.css file and a reset.css file. Link those files up in the head of your html file. Make sure everything is linked up and working before moving on.</p>
