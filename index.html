      <h3>Your assignment this week (and next): Redesign a homepage. Either The New York Times, Buzzfeed, or the IDS.</h3>
      <p>For desktop, tablet and mobile.</p>
      <p>You've coded up a news site before and you've learned the basics of using media queries to style things for different screen sizes — so use both of those assignments to inform this one.</p>
      <h3>Here's what you'll need to do to get started.</h3>
      <p>This is a slightly longer assignment than normal because it's more hefty. But before you jump into the code, you should do some sketching — either on paper, in Illustrator, Photoshop or any other program you're comfortable in.</p>
      <p>By <strong>Wednesday (Nov. 4)</strong> you should send me some rough sketches of your redesigned homepage. Just drop them in Slack. I'll give you some feedback and then you can hit the code.</p>

      <h3>When you're ready to start coding ...</h3>
      <p>... you'll want to start this project like every other one.</p>
      <p>Create a git repo. Name it <code>news-redesign</code></p>
      <p>Now you should be off and running.</p>
      <p>You'll want to copy and paste text, headlines and images directly from the site you decide to redesign. You can include as much or as little as you'd like, but your final homepage should feel complete. (i.e. You'll need to work in ads, a footer, related links, etc.)</p>

      <h3>Things to think about</h3>
      <p>Depending on the site you choose to redesign, think about audience. The audience of Buzzfeed is different than the Audience of The New York Times is different than the audience of the IDS.</p>
      <p>Break it down into simple parts. Don't get overwhelemed. Use your news-site project as a guide for how to set up a basic column structure (although it doesn't  need to — and shouldn't — look like that).</p>
      <p>Here are a few examples of redesigns. <a href="http://andyrutledge.com/news-redux.php">Andy Rutledge, The New York Times</a> | <a href="http://nytimes.tematroinoi.com/">Behance, The New York Times</a> <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/24069651/Buzzfeed-Redesign">Buzzfeed</a>.</p>

      <h3>This whole project is due Monday, Nov. 9, so a little over a week.</h3>
      <p>Get me your sketches by Wednesday. Don't suffer in silence. Reach out at any point if you need help.</p>
