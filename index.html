      <h3>The Assignment ...</h3>

      <p>... this week is simple.</p>
      <p>1. Stop by on Tuesday or Thursday between 8:30 and 9:30 for a code review. It will only take a few minutes, you can ask any and all questions you've got, and I'll review your rio-2016 code to make sure everything looks good.</p>
      <p>2. Start to redesign your portfolio sites, keeping everything you've learned so far in mind. Add your current projects (lesson-3 and rio poster) to your projects list. Push your changes to github.</p>
      <p>That's all. See you soon.</p>
