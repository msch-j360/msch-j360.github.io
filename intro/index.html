    <p>Thanks for enrolling in this course. The Internet is a fun place, so this should be fun.</p>

    <h3>What I need you to do now</h3>

    <p>Consider this assignment 1. Normally, we’d take care of all of this junk in the classroom on day one, but alas, no classroom.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Schedule a brief Google Hangout with me. I’d like to meet with each of you via video chat for just a few minutes on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday to put a name with a face. Email me a time that works for you. I’m free anytime after 6 p.m. all three days.</li>    
    <li>Download <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. It’s free.</li>
    <li>Create a <a href="github.com">github</a> account. This is where all of your code and assignments will live. Also free.</li>
    <li>Join our <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> group. You’ll get an invite from me shortly. If you don’t, let me know.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>OK, so what's this all about?</h3>

    <p>Brian Boyer, the visuals director at NPR, recently went on this <a href="https://twitter.com/brianboyer/status/633741935463698432">mini-twitter rant</a>.</p>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m pissed at J-schools for creating young designers with awesome print layout skills.</p>&mdash; Brian Boyer (@brianboyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/brianboyer/status/633741935463698432">August 18, 2015</a></blockquote>

    <p>Let’s try to change that. </p>

    <p>This is going to be a more technical course than you’re probably used to.</p>

    <img class="full" src="http://i.imgur.com/MvMxQ1a.gif" alt="">

    <p>A lot of people think a(n) <del>Adobe</del> product is going to come along that will make learning to code (and design, frankly) obsolete. That hasn’t happened yet. These days, web design is design <em>and</em> code. So yes, you’ll be learning to code. Black screen, white text, matrix-level code.</p>

    <p>In this course we’ll be using tools that real people use in the real world. Nothing against OnCourse, Onestart, Canvas or anything else IU cooks up, but people don’t use those in real life. We’ll be using good ol’ email, <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="github.com">Github</a>, Google Hangouts, <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en">Google Chrome</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a>. </p>

    <p>Here’s how I imagine, in a dream world, things will go down. </p>

    <h3>I’ll upload and email one video lesson every Monday.</h3>

    <p>Length will vary, but I imagine it will be around an hour. (Considering that if this were an in-person class, we’d be meeting twice a week, 2 hours each, this seems like a steal.)</p>

    <h3>You’ll have one assignment per week, due on Friday before midnight.</h3>

    <p>You’ll get one of three grades. Done well (like an A), done (like a C), not done (like an F). Your final grade is all of your assignments averaged. No late assignments will be accepted. After an assignment is graded, you can resubmit as many times as you’d like for a better grade. Ambition will be rewarded over ease. You’re learning. This is hard and confusing. Failure while aiming high is fine. Not aiming high isn’t. </p>

    <h3>Throughout the week, I’ll hold office hours at various times for several hours.</h3>

    <p>Once I talk to all of you, I’ll try to figure out times that work for everyone. To help you when you get stuck and when your code won’t run, we’ll do this through a combination of Google Hangouts and Slack (group chat).</p>

    <h3>I want you to get a lot out of this course.</h3>

    <p>In this course I’m trying to give you skills that you can use immediately, add to your resume, and will help you get a job.</p>

    <p>Specifically, at the end of this course you should</p>

    <ul>
    <li>have better idea of how the internet works</li>
    <li>know how the command line and git/github works</li>
    <li>know how to design and code responsive websites with HTML/CSS and a (tiny) bit of javascript</li>
    <li>understand the design principles that the web is built on</li>
    <li>have several solid portfolio pieces (including a site to host them on)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To that end, I’ll get up early, stay up late, and otherwise help you as much as I can so you succeed. If something’s not working, please let me know. We’ll learn together, make it better and move on. If there’s something I’m not covering that you want me to, let me know. The syllabus can change. </p>

    <h3>A tiny bit about me.</h3>

    <p>By day, I’m a graphics editor at <em>The New York Times</em> where I report and make <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/13/world/americas/mexico-drug-kingpin-prison-escape.html">maps</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/upshot/how-presidential-campaigns-became-two-year-marathons.html">charts</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/01/07/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-shooting-maps.html">diagrams</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/09/06/voting-blocs/">interactive graphics</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/21/us/your-contribution-to-the-california-drought.html">other things that don’t necessarily fall into one of those categories</a>. I graduated from the IU School of Journalism in 2011, so I can likely empathize with your situation more than some of your other instructors. This is my first time teaching at IU (but not my first time teaching), so that might be why this note is dripping with idealism and optimism.</p>

    <p>A full course schedule and the first video lesson is coming soon. </p>
